  <a href=\"https://github.com/mose/greeby\">greeby</a> project, that should
  help me in the writing of this newsletter. But because I could not help it,
  I choosed to use all the things I wanted to try and so I spend lot of time
  exploring sinatra, mongo, and ember.js. A lot of fun, but it's not ready yet."
