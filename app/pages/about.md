# About Green Ruby

## Genesis

The Newsletter began in june 2012 from the habit I had to
send weekly newsletter in [Codegreen][1] for our team to know what is
happenning in our company,. That was purely a teamwork tool for general
transparency. But with time passing I also included there some links to
what I was finding around that would be of interest for my geek colleagues.

That CodeGreen Internal newsletter began to be cluttered with various links
at the bottom of it. So I decided to separate that links gathering bunch in
another newsletter. But then it could also be useful for my friends, out of
the scope of our team.

## Green Birth

At that time I had to test [Mailchimp][2] service for one of our projects, so because
they offer a free package when volume is not too big, I thought I should just create
that newsletter as a public freeely available publication.

So in february 2013 I sent the first Green Ruby Newsletter to 3 subscribers. Well,
mostly our team :) Then it became a weekly habit, so I got a domain name for it,
and organicaly it's growing slowly.

## The redactor gear

Codegreen paid for my [Newsblur][3] account so I can
follow a bunch of feeds. Google reader was my first tool but well, they are closing,
and actually Newsblur is much better. It's open source and the guy that makes it
does a great job (too bad it's in python and not in ruby).

I'm also loading a bunch of podcasts on my phone and after having tried a lot of
podcast softwares I'm really happy with [Podkicker][4], it's just very convenient and
it has all I need with the free version. So in my 40 minutes tele commuting to go
to work, I just get the ears busy. I tried to use [Gpodder][5] but it's not totally perfect
and the support in podcast clients is not as good as it should be. So I don't
stick on it, maybe it will evolve and I will get back to it.

But I also get a lot of news by just wandering around on [Geekli.st][10], on [Coderbits][11],
hacker news, and I subscribed to a bunch of various newsletters. I also watch the new gems
feeds from [@rubygems-alt][12] and I retweet stuff of interest on [@mo5e][17], [@cogtw][13] and/or
[@greenrubist][16] (those 3 are my alternate twitter identities).

Each week [William][14] (aka xenor) also sends me a list of links. But I definately
don't use any facebook feeds. For some reason, this is a place I avoid the most I can.

## What next ?

My ambition there is to keep it non-comercial, and change it to be more community
driven. The preparation of the letter is eating a big part of my saturdays for the last
13 weeks and I don't think I can keep up the same pace for long time.

The idea I have about the community driven thing is by engineering some automation on
the news gathering (to replace newsblur), have a place where the news can be triaged
by various people, a little bit like it is on [Hacker News][6] with a vote system. But
the gatherign won't limit to blog posts and rss feeds, there would also be podcasts
and video feeds. There is now a lot of possibilities in automation on feeds aggregation.
I worked on a project that already does that feeds aggregation, named "the Blux". And I expect
to replicate parts of it for my Green Ruby Engine.

But also, as usual, this project is also an occasion to play with recent technologies or
stuff I want to know more about, otherwise where is the fun ? So here comes [Ember.js][7],
on the top of [Sinatra][15] with [mongoDB][8], and there will be much more on the road
(thinking about trying [Sponges][9] too).
