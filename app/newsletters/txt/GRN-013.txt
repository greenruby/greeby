Green Ruby News #013 - may 5th 2013
-------------------------------

Edito
-----------------
This week I worked a little more on the <a href="https://github.com/mose/greeby">greeby</a> project, that should help me in the writing of this newsletter. I spent lot of time exploring sinatra, mongo, and ember.js. A lot of fun, but it's not ready yet. So I made a <a href="https://github.com/mose/greeby/blob/master/lib/tasks/generate_task.rb">rake task</a> for the generation in the while. You can check what's planned (and participate) on the <a href="https://trello.com/board/greeby-platform/513fd48aa7ed906115001a04">taskboard on Trello</a>.
