              <h1>About Green Ruby</h1>
              
              <h2>Genesis</h2>
              
              <p>The Newsletter began in june 2012 from the habit I had to
              send weekly newsletter in <a href="http://codegreenit.com" title="Code Green website">Codegreen</a> for our team to know what is
              happenning in our company,. That was purely a teamwork tool for general
              transparency. But with time passing I also included there some links to
              what I was finding around that would be of interest for my geek colleagues.</p>
              
              <p>That CodeGreen Internal newsletter began to be cluttered with various links
              at the bottom of it. So I decided to separate that links gathering bunch in
              another newsletter. But then it could also be useful for my friends, out of
              the scope of our team.</p>
              
              <h2>Green Birth</h2>
              
              <p>At that time I had to test <a href="http://mailchimp.com" title="Mass mailing from the Chimps">Mailchimp</a> service for one of our projects, so because
              they offer a free package when volume is not too big, I thought I should just create
              that newsletter as a public freeely available publication.</p>
              
              <p>So in february 2013 I sent the first Green Ruby Newsletter to 3 subscribers. Well,
              mostly our team :) Then it became a weekly habit, so I got a domain name for it,
              and organicaly it's growing slowly.</p>
              
              <h2>The redactor gear</h2>
              
              <p>Codegreen paid for my <a href="http://newsblur.com" title="RSS feeds aggregation and reader">Newsblur</a> account so I can
              follow a bunch of feeds. Google reader was my first tool but well, they are closing,
              and actually Newsblur is much better. It's open source and the guy that makes it
              does a great job (too bad it's in python and not in ruby).</p>
              
              <p>I'm also loading a bunch of podcasts on my phone and after having tried a lot of
              podcast softwares I'm really happy with <a href="http://www.podkicker.com/" title="Podkicker">Podkicker</a>, it's just very convenient and
              it has all I need with the free version. So in my 40 minutes tele commuting to go
              to work, I just get the ears busy. I tried to use <a href="https://gpodder.net/user/mose" title="Mose podcasts list on gPodder">Gpodder</a> but it's not totally perfect
              and the support in podcast clients is not as good as it should be. So I don't
              stick on it, maybe it will evolve and I will get back to it.</p>
              
              <p>But I also get a lot of news by just wandering around on <a href="https://geekli.st/" title="Geeks social network">Geekli.st</a>, on <a href="https://coderbits.com" title="Skill gathering for geeks">Coderbits</a>,
              hacker news, and I subscribed to a bunch of various newsletters. I also watch the new gems
              feeds from <a href="https://twitter.com/RubyGemsAlt" title="Tweet feed of uploaded gems">@rubygems-alt</a> and I retweet stuff of interest on <a href="https://twitter.com/mo5e" title="Personal tweet feed of mose">@mo5e</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/cogtw" title="Technical News tweet feed from mose at code green">@cogtw</a> and/or
              <a href="https://twitter.com/grenrubist" title="New tweet feed from Green Ruby">@greenrubist</a> (those 3 are my alternate twitter identities).</p>
              
              <p>Each week <a href="https://github.com/tubaxenor" title="The Xenor with his tuba">William</a> (aka xenor) also sends me a list of links. But I definately
              don't use any facebook feeds. For some reason, this is a place I avoid the most I can.</p>
              
              <h2>What next ?</h2>
              
              <p>My ambition there is to keep it non-comercial, and change it to be more community
              driven. The preparation of the letter is eating a big part of my saturdays for the last
              13 weeks and I don't think I can keep up the same pace for long time.</p>
              
              <p>The idea I have about the community driven thing is by engineering some automation on
              the news gathering (to replace newsblur), have a place where the news can be triaged
              by various people, a little bit like it is on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/" title="Hacker News">Hacker News</a> with a vote system. But
              the gatherign won't limit to blog posts and rss feeds, there would also be podcasts
              and video feeds. There is now a lot of possibilities in automation on feeds aggregation.
              I worked on a project that already does that feeds aggregation, named "the Blux". And I expect
              to replicate parts of it for my Green Ruby Engine.</p>
              
              <p>But also, as usual, this project is also an occasion to play with recent technologies or
              stuff I want to know more about, otherwise where is the fun ? So here comes <a href="http://emberjs.com/" title="Ember js web appilcation client side">Ember.js</a>,
              on the top of <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/" title="Put this in your pipe and smoke it">Sinatra</a> with <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/" title="MongoDB NoSQL database">mongoDB</a>, and there will be much more on the road
              (thinking about trying <a href="http://af83.github.io/sponges/" title="Turn any Ruby object into a daemon controlling an army of sponges.">Sponges</a> too).</p>
